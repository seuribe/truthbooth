Software running the 'Projected Memory' booth at Sachsenhausen Memorial and Museum in Oranienburg, Germany

> Projected Memory is a nonprofit initiative meant to enable and encourage individuals to reflect on the meaning of their visits to memorials and museums by recording their thoughts and feelings in a semi-private, interactive audio/video booth. The project will also include an online archive of visitor impressions which, over time, should enhance our understanding of the various ways successive generations connect to historically traumatic sites and events. Projected Memory is a collective attempt to consider not only what happened here, but also what happens to me when Iâ€™m here.

This code is rather old and might not work out of the box with current tools.

Back then (2013) there weren't that many tools for building a nice interface, recording video and audio in real time, and working in a small, (relatively) inexpensive computer.
These days (2023) it's probably easier to use web technologies.
